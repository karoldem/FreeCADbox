Purpose of this macro is to draw arbitrary number of perpendicular lines. Every subsequent line starts, where the previous ends and they are perpendicular, so the only arguments are length and direction of said lines.

For now there are two functionalities:

    - drawing lines up/down, left/right, up/down, left/right...
    
    - drawing lines and defining direction of next line.
